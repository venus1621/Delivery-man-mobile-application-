└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🎛️ Configuration Options

### **Change Distance Threshold:**

In `providers/delivery-provider.js` line 117:

```javascript
const PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD = 200; // Change this number

// Examples:
// 100 - Closer alert (100 meters)
// 300 - Earlier alert (300 meters)
// 500 - Very early alert (500 meters)
```

### **Change Vibration Pattern:**

Line 135:

```javascript
Vibration.vibrate([0, 500, 200, 500, 200, 500]);
// Format: [wait, vibrate, wait, vibrate, wait, vibrate]
// All values in milliseconds
```

### **Change Sound Volume:**

Line 178:

```javascript
volume: 1.0  // 1.0 = 100%, 0.5 = 50%, etc.
```

## 🧪 Testing Without Driving

You can test the alert system without actually driving to a location:

### **Option 1: Use a Nearby Location**

Set the destination to somewhere nearby (like 150m away) and walk there.

### **Option 2: Add Test Button** (Advanced)

Add this to your dashboard for testing:

```javascript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={async () => {
  const mockOrder = {
    orderCode: 'TEST-001',
    userName: 'Test Customer',
    destinationLocation: {
      lat: 9.0125,  // Your current location
      lng: 38.7635
    }
  };
  
  const mockLocation = {
    latitude: 9.0125,
    longitude: 38.7635,
    accuracy: 10,
    timestamp: Date.now()
  };
  
  await checkProximityAndAlert(mockOrder, mockLocation, 'TEST-001');
}}>
  <Text>🔔 Test Proximity Alert</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

## 📊 Console Logs to Expect

### **When Approaching:**

```
🔔 PROXIMITY ALERT! Within 187m of destination for order: ORD-706807
🔊 Playing proximity alarm
```

### **When Dismissed:**

```
🔇 Proximity alarm stopped
```

### **If Sound Fails (Fallback):**

```
❌ Error playing alarm: [Error: unable to load sound]
```

The system will still vibrate and show the alert!

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: No sound plays**

**Solution:**
1. Check that `proximity-alarm.mp3` exists in `assets/sounds/`
2. Check the file is a valid MP3
3. Check your phone's volume is up
4. The app will still vibrate and show alert

### **Problem: Alert triggers too early/late**

**Solution:**
- Change `PROXIMITY_THRESHOLD` value (line 117)
- 200m = ~2 city blocks
- 100m = ~1 city block

### **Problem: Alert repeats constantly**

**Solution:**
- This shouldn't happen - the system tracks notified orders
- If it does, check console for errors
- Restart the app
